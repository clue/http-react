# clue/buzz-react [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clue/reactphp-buzz.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clue/reactphp-buzz)

Simple async HTTP client for concurrently interacting with multiple HTTP servers,
fetching URLs, talking to RESTful APIs, downloading files, following redirects
etc. all at the same time.

This library is heavily inspired by the great
[kriswallsmith/Buzz](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/Buzz)
project. However, instead of blocking on each request, it relies on
[React PHP's EventLoop](https://github.com/reactphp/event-loop) to process
multiple requests in parallel.

React PHP also provides the package
[react/http-client](https://github.com/reactphp/event-loop) which provides a
streaming HTTP client implementation.
That package is ideally suited for accessing streaming APIs or processing huge
requests, but requires quite a bit of boilerplate code if all you want to do is
to access a *normal* website or your average RESTful API.

As such, this projects aims at providing a higher level API that is easy to use
in order to process multiple HTTP requests concurrently without having to
mess with most of the low level details of the underlying
[react/http-client](https://github.com/reactphp/http-client).

> Note: This project is in beta stage! Feel free to report any issues you encounter.

## Quickstart example

Once [installed](#install), you can use the following code to access a
HTTP webserver and send some simple HTTP GET requests:

```php

$client = new Browser($loop);

$client->get('http://www.google.com/')->then(function (Response $result) {
    var_dump($result->getHeaders(), $result->getBody());
});

$loop->run();
```

## Install

The recommended way to install this library is [through composer](http://getcomposer.org). [New to composer?](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

```JSON

    "require": {
        "clue/buzz-react": "0.1.*"
    }
